        <h1>The Focus on Tech and its Effects on People</h1>
        <br>
        
        <p class="text.#0df091">
We no longer choses to live with tech, it lives around, and within us. We will analyze the effects of technology on the individual the population through the lense of a historical, individual consequence, ethical and transparent perspectives.  
 </p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>A Multi-faceted Perspective on Technology</h2>
       <br>
          <h3>A Quick and Short Historical Summary</h3>
        <br>
          <p>Technology is that second cousin that was never a second thought but someone you saw during the occasional family reunion.  In the 80's we lived with record players, corded land-line phones and oh yeah, if you were lucky enough, the 8-bit Commodore 64.  The gen x-ers were introduced to the internet and cassestte tapes that were replaced with cd's. The transition from tape decks to cd players seemed to come at a fast pace.  Today the next generations, gen z, has know tech and its digital landscape as a child that grows up with a pet, its meaningful and the z-er would not know what to do without it.  As technology evolves the previous generations will look back and say "remember when vr came out?" The technology is a very close part of us in history and will increase and will continue to change our lives in the future </p>
        <br>
          <h3>Propagandized Tools</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Technology is no longer that second cousin that we see once in a while, it has become the infastructure of our homes and is the closet relative to us. It's how we secure ourselves, it tracks what we buy, where we bank, who we date, how we work and how active we are or are not.  It is ubiquitous and because it would be nearly impossible to track every single bit of collected data, it has become invisible.  As tech runs the background of our lives, it slowly erodes our choices.  
          </p>
          <p>To be fair, there are numerous good and positive outcomes form technology.  The modern day miracle of pace makers, blood and plasma transfusions, robotic surgical tools and many other technological breakthroughs.  Today major diseases are cured with the high tech tools that allow the human eye to see how viruses spread.  So what is the cost to us? The real cost of unchecked tech isn't just time, it's depth.  Our attention becomes fractured, our relationships become mediated.  Our thinking becomes surface and then reactive where the ablity to critically think becomes a thing of the past and the worst, our curiosity is flattened into a search bar.  We can look at a more in-depth topic of how technology begins to erase the humaness, thus our humanity but we'll save that for the rabbit-hole not too far from here.  
          </p>
          <br>
    
          </p>
        
          <h3>The Persuasion of Relevance</h3>
        <br>
          <p>Well, there's no way technology has come this far and so close to our bodies without good ole propaganda.  This type of marketing has had to appeal to our emotions and it started back in the mid 50's when tv begun to replace the radio. Even in radio's hayday, the commercials were rife with storytelling, political opinions were dolled out in dramatic emotional persuasions.  Cinema was and still is used to condition cultural norms and they do it with lot's of emotional appeal.  Just as the cinematic industustry uses expressive appeals, the microchip makers use fear the convince pet lovers to chip their pets to keep them safe and returnable if they are lost.  This is the subtly technology making it's grand entrance to our willingness to embed tech into our brains and body.  The next steps are smart watches, oh but they are here, then there will be bloodsugar measures, wait these have been on the market and have been used for some time.  Eventually there will be nanopharmecutical where drugs are injested to release nano-sized bots that grip onto arteries to send data to medical professionals to measure and record the integrity of one's cardiovascular health.    </p>
